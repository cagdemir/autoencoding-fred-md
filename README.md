# autoencoding-fred-md
This project is created to use autoencoders to apply dimension reduction techniques to Fred-MD database.

I provided a simple auto-encoder script written in PyTorch to the module in my GitHub page, as an example to the data shrinkage methodologies for macroeconomics data. The scripts to generate data can be found in the repo https://github.com/cagdemir/fred-md-calculation
